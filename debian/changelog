elementary-meta (1.0) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add update.cfg for new germinate-update-metapackage (Build-Depends:
    germinate (>= 0.16)). Replace update with a trivial wrapper. We now pull
    seeds directly from bzr over sftp by default, so update will only work
    if you're in the ubuntu-core-dev team; run germinate-update-metapackage
    without options or temporarily replace "sftp" with "http" in update.cfg
    to update without authentication.
  * Switch to edgy seeds.
  * Seems like as good a time as any to bump to 1.0.
